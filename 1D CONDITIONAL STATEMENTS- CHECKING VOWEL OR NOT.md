## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- check whether it is positive, negative, or zero.

## AIM  
To write a Python program to read a number and check whether it is positive, negative, or zero using the conditional statement.
## ALGORITHM  
1. Start the program.
2.Read a number from the user and store it in the variable n.
3.Check if the number is greater than 0:
4.If true, print that the number is positive.
5.Use elif to check if the number is less than 0:
6.If true, print that the number is negative.
7.Use else to handle the case when the number is equal to 0:
8.Print that the number is 0.
9.End the program.

## PROGRAM
212223060293
E.S.UMA

n=int(input())
if n>0:
    print(f"{n} is a Positive number")
elif n<0:
    print(f"{n} is a Negative number")
else:
    print("Number is 0")

## RESULT
Thus the Python program to read a number and check whether it is positive, negative, or zero using the conditional statement is implemented and excecuted successfully.
