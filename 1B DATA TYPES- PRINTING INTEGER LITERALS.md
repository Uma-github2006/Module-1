# Experiment No: 1B-  Read two numbers and convert them into a complex number.

## AIM  
To write a Python program to read two numbers and convert them into a complex number.

## ALGORITHM  
1.Start the program.
2.Read the first number from the user and store it in variable a.
3.Read the second number from the user and store it in variable b.
4.Convert the two numbers into a complex number using the complex() function and store the result in variable c.
5.Print the complex number c.
6.End the program.

## PROGRAM
